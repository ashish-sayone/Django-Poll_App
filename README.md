# django-poll_app

Developed using the official beginner level tutorial from **Django Documentation** for the purpose of self learning

**Link to Documentation:** [Django Tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/intro/tutorial01/)

The purpose of this self learning project was to get an introduction to Web Development using Python Django. The app that I created can be used to conduct Polls where the Admin can list down the different Poll Questions and Different Choice of answers. End users can use the web application to see the 5 most recent questions and cast their votes.

### End User Views

**Link to Vote View:** http://localhost:8000/polls/<question_id>/vote

**Link to Results View:** http://localhost:8000/polls/<question_id>/results

### Admin Views

**Link to Admin View:** http://localhost:8000/admin/
